# Debugging & Logs

This page explains how to debug FinTra during development, handle logs, and collect information when issues arise.

## 1. Overview

FinTra uses Flutter's built-in debugging tools and structured logging to help identify:
- App crashes
- UI rendering issues
- State inconsistencies
- Database errors
- Performance bottlenecks

## 2. Enabling Debug Logs

View logs in the terminal with:

```bash
flutter run
```

### What's Logged:
- UI lifecycle events
- Errors & stack traces
- Supabase query responses
- Widget rebuilds (if enabled)

### Best Practices:
- Use `debugPrint("message")` instead of `print()`
- Avoid logging in large loops
- Keep logs concise and meaningful

## 3. Debugging Database Issues

### Logging Queries:
```dart
final response = await client.from('expenses').insert(data);
if (response.error != null) {
  debugPrint("DB Error: ${response.error!.message}");
}
```

### Common Issues:
- Incorrect `monthKey` format
- Missing `userId`
- Row Level Security (RLS) restrictions
- Network timeouts

## 4. Performance Debugging

### Enable Performance Overlay
In `main.dart`:
```dart
WidgetsApp.showPerformanceOverlayOverride = true;
```

### Using DevTools:
```bash
flutter pub global activate devtools
devtools
```

## 5. Common Scenarios

### Expenses Not Updating
- Verify write operation success
- Check `monthKey` format
- Confirm state updates trigger UI refresh

### App Freezes
- Look for heavy operations in `build()`
- Check for missing `await` keywords
- Monitor for infinite loops

## 6. Best Practices

### Do:
- Keep logs short and meaningful
- Log before/after key operations
- Use structured debug messages
- Remove sensitive data from logs

### Don't:
- Commit debug logs to production
- Log sensitive information
- Overload logs with unnecessary details

## 7. Device Logs

### Android:
```bash
adb logcat | grep flutter
```

### iOS:
```bash
xcrun simctl spawn booted log show --predicate 'process == "FinTra"'
```

## 8. Release Builds

Remove all debug logs before release:
```dart
if (kDebugMode) {
  debugPrint("Debug only log");
}
```
