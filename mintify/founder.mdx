## **Dibyendu Mondal**
**Role:** Founder & Product Lead
**Mission:** To build India’s most behaviour-focused personal finance app — a system that fixes overspending, builds structure, and helps young earners gain control over their money.

## About the Founder

Dibyendu started FinTra with a clear belief: **financial discipline is a behaviour problem, not a maths problem.**
Most people in the 21–33 age group lose money not because of low income, but because:

- There is no structure
- No reminders
- No accountability
- No behaviour-driven guidance

FinTra was created to solve exactly that — using simple design, strong psychology, and habit-forming flows.

Dibyendu’s journey combines product thinking, solo development, and a deep obsession with creating a finance tool that genuinely changes user behaviour.
