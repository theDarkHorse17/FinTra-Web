We only share data in these rare cases:

There is **no third-party data sharing** for marketing or analytics that identifies users.

---

## **5. User Rights**
Every user has the right to:
- Access their data
- Edit or correct entries
- Delete any or all data
- Request account deletion
- Export their data anytime

Users maintain **complete control** over their financial logs.

## **6. Data Deletion**
When a user deletes:

There is no hidden backup or retained copy.

---

## **7. Security Practices**
FinTra uses:
- Database row-level security
- Multi-layer permissions
- Encrypted connections
- Strict access logs
- Secure server configuration

Internal access is limited to the Founder.

## **8. Third-Party Services**

All third-party tools comply with modern data protection standards.

---

## **9. Changes to This Policy**

All changes will be communicated transparently.
