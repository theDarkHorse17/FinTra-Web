## FinTra’s Core Thesis

**People don’t need more spreadsheets.  
They need behavioural accountability.**

Most financial tools optimise for visibility.  
FinTra optimises for **behavioural correction at the moment decisions are made**.

## How FinTra Enforces Accountability

FinTra operates as a **lightweight behavioural control loop** across the salary cycle.

### 1. Salary-Day Heads-Up
The system activates the moment salary is credited, establishing intent before spending begins.  
This is the most critical intervention point of the month.

---

### 2. Time-Based Nudges
Context-aware prompts are delivered at high-risk decision windows:

- **11:00 AM** — daytime discretionary spending  
- **3:00 PM** — fatigue-driven or impulsive purchases  
- **10:30 PM** — emotional or late-night spending  

These are not reminders to log expenses, but prompts to **pause and reassess intent**.

---

### 3. Category-Level Reminders
Users are reminded of pacing and limits at the category level, not through generic budget alerts.  
This preserves flexibility while preventing silent overspend.

---

### 4. Emotional Spend Warnings
When spending patterns indicate stress, boredom, or impulse-driven behaviour, FinTra flags the deviation early — before it compounds.

---

### 5. Weekly Report Cards
Instead of end-of-month postmortems, users receive weekly summaries focused on:
- Adherence to intent  
- Behavioural drift  
- Recovery opportunities  

The goal is correction, not guilt.

## Summary

FinTra does not try to make users “financially perfect.”  
It provides **just enough friction** to keep behaviour aligned with intent.

That is where long-term financial discipline is actually built.
