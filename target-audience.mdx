FinTra is intentionally designed for a **specific salary phase**, not a generic “everyone with money” audience.

## 🎯 Target Profile

- **Age:** 21–33  
- **Location:** India (current scope)  
- **Monthly Income:** ₹30,000 – ₹1,23,000  
- **Primary Pain:** Overspending driven by lifestyle inflation and lack of financial structure  

This cohort represents salaried users who have crossed survival mode but have not yet built disciplined financial systems.

## Why this Income Range Exists

The ₹30k–₹1.23L range is not arbitrary.  
It is derived from **urban cost-of-living realities** and **behavioral patterns**.

### Below ₹30,000
- Spending is dominated by survival costs  
- Little to no discretionary flexibility  
- Financial decisions are reactive, not optimizable  

### Above ₹1,23,000

Users in this income bracket typically operate from a position of **financial abundance** rather than constraint.

- Core living costs are comfortably covered  
- Disposable income allows flexibility and experimentation  
- Short-term financial inefficiencies rarely create meaningful stress  

As a result:
- Many adopt financial advisors, automated investment products, or multiple bank-led tools  
- Manual day-to-day money engagement drops sharply  
- Behaviour shifts from **control-seeking** to **delegation-seeking**

Unless individuals in this bracket demonstrate consistently poor financial decision-making, they are **not FinTra’s core customer**.

FinTra is designed for users who **need structure to prevent mistakes**, not those who can afford to absorb them.


**FinTra operates in the transition zone** — where money starts compounding, but structure has not yet caught up.

## Average Monthly Living Costs (India)

These ranges represent **typical single-person urban expenses** (rent + food + transport + utilities).

| City Tier | Examples | Min (₹) | Avg (₹) | Max (₹) |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Tier 1 | Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata | 28,000 | 45,000 | 65,000 |
| Tier 2 | Pune, Hyderabad, Chennai | 22,000 | 35,000 | 50,000 |
| Tier 3 | Indore, Kochi, Jaipur | 16,000 | 25,000 | 38,000 |

**Key Insight:**  
At ~₹30k income, users begin to see discretionary surplus.  
At ~₹1.2L income, users begin to outsource financial thinking.

## Behavioral Insight

This cohort is typically:
- **Spending-first**, saving later (if at all)  
- Managing multiple lifestyle upgrades simultaneously  
- Lacking a month-level financial control system  

FinTra intervenes **before habits solidify**, not after damage is done.

---

## Scope Definition

- **Current Scope:** India (urban & semi-urban salaried population)  
- **Long-Term Scope:** Global expansion across comparable salary-driven economies  

The problem FinTra solves is **not geography-specific** — it is salary-cycle specific.

---

## Summary

FinTra’s first legitimate customer base is:
> Salaried users who have enough money to make mistakes,  
> but not enough structure to prevent them.

That is the window where proactive financial systems compound the hardest.
