# Testing Guide

This page explains how to test the FinTra application across devices, builds, and environments. It covers manual testing, automated testing (future), debugging steps, and guidelines for internal testers.

## 1. Testing Overview

FinTra is currently in **MVP stage**, so testing focuses primarily on:

- App stability
- Expense logging accuracy
- UI/UX consistency
- Month-key calculations
- Database correctness
- Crash-free navigation
- Edge-case handling

Testing ensures every user action behaves predictably and securely.

## 2. Types of Testing

### Manual Testing (Current Focus)
All testers validate:
- UI flows
- Expense addition
- Savings updates
- Category-level breakdown
- Login & logout
- Month switching
- Overview calculations

### Automated Testing (Phase 2)
Planned for future:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Widget tests

## 3. Test Environment Setup

### Install APK
Download the latest internal build:

👉 **[Download FinTra APK](https://fintrahq.com/)**


### Enable Developer Mode (If needed)
1. Go to **Settings → About Phone**
2. Tap **Build Number** 7 times
3. Enable **Install Unknown Apps**

### Install the App
Tap the APK → Install.

## 4. Core Test Scenarios

### A) Authentication
- Login with valid credentials
- Login with invalid credentials
- Logout flow
- Session persistence after app restart

### B) Expense Management
- Add expense in each category
- Add two quick expenses in a row
- Add large expenses (₹1–2 lakh)
- Verify correct total updates
- Verify correct "Left to spend" value

### C) Savings Engine
- Add savings
- Remove savings
- Update monthly blueprint
- Check if ring charts update instantly

### D) Overview Page
Check all components:
- Total spent
- Total saved
- Line chart current vs last month
- Category-wise ring chart
- Month switching

### E) App Navigation
- Move between tabs
- Open/close dialogs
- Navigate back multiple times
- Test on slow device

### F) Error Handling
- Adding empty values
- Invalid characters
- Network disconnected mode
- Rapid taps

## 5. Device Testing Matrix

### Recommended devices for testing

| Device Type | Example Models | Why Test Here |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| Low-end | Redmi 7, Vivo Y Series | slow CPU, UI lag detection |
| Mid-range | Samsung A/M Series | general behavioral testing |
| High-end | Pixel / OnePlus | animation consistency |
| Tablet (optional) | Samsung Tab | future responsive planning |

## 6. Bug Reporting Process

When reporting a bug, include:

### 1. Steps to reproduce
Clear step-by-step actions.

### 2. Expected result
What should happen.

### 3. Actual result
What actually happened.

### 4. Device details
- Device model
- Android version
- App version

### 5. Screenshot / Screen recording
Very helpful for debugging.

**Example:**
```
Bug Title: Wrong savings calculation after adding new expense
Device: Xiaomi Redmi 9
Android: 13
Steps:
1. Add expense of ₹500 in Health
2. Savings becomes negative
Expected: Savings should not change
Actual: Savings becomes -₹500
```

## 7. Crash Testing

Try to intentionally break the app:

- Rapid tapping on buttons
- Switching tabs continuously
- Repeatedly adding/removing expenses
- Opening dialogs and rotating the phone
- Killing and reopening app quickly

Any crash must be reported.

## 8. Performance Testing

Focus on:

- Smooth scrolling
- Zero jank in page transitions
- Expense addition < 300ms
- Savings updates < 200ms
- Overview load time < 1 sec

Use the Flutter Performance Overlay (optional).

## 9. Pre-release Checklist

Before pushing a new APK:

- [ ] All pages load without errors
- [ ] No crashes in navigation
- [ ] Expenses update instantly
- [ ] Overview shows correct month data
- [ ] Savings updates correctly
- [ ] No debug logs in release build
- [ ] App icon + version updated
- [ ] Obfuscation build tested

## 10. Future Testing Roadmap

### Phase 2
- Unit tests for expense engine
- Integration tests for authentication
- Automated UI tests (Flutter driver)
- Crashlytics integration

### Phase 3
- Load testing
- Multi-device automated farms
- Real user monitoring

## Summary

FinTra testing focuses on:

> **Stability, accuracy, performance, and real-user behavior.**

A clean, crash-free experience is the priority as we scale.
