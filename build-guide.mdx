This guide explains how to build, package, and distribute the FinTra application for local testing, internal releases, and production-ready APKs.

---

## **1. Prerequisites**

Before building FinTra, install the following:

### **Required**

* Flutter SDK (Stable Channel)
* Android Studio (with Android SDK + Build Tools)
* Java Development Kit (JDK 11 or above)
* Git

### **Verify Your Environment**

```bash
flutter doctor
```

---

## **2. Clone the Repository (Private)**

FinTra’s repository is private. Authorized users can clone it:

```bash
git clone <your-private-repo-url>
cd FinTra
```

Update to the latest version:

```bash
git pull
```

---

## **3. Install Dependencies**

Run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

This installs all Flutter packages required by the project.

---

## **4. Build Types**

You can generate **Debug**, **Profile**, or **Release** builds depending on your needs.

---

### **A) Debug Build (Local Development)**

```bash
flutter build apk
```

Output:

```
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk
```

Debug builds include:

* Debug banner
* Logs enabled
* Fast iteration

---

### **B) Profile Build (Performance Testing)**

```bash
flutter build apk --profile
```

Useful for animation/performance benchmarking.

---

### **C) Release Build (For Internal Distribution)**

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

Output:

```
build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

Release builds are optimized and suitable for testers.

---

## **5. Signing the Release (Optional)**

For internal APK distribution, signing is optional — Flutter generates an unsigned release that works on most devices.

When you’re ready for Play Store deployment, you will need to:

1. Generate a keystore
2. Add `key.properties`
3. Update `android/app/build.gradle`

I can generate this guide if needed.

## **6. Download the Latest Build**

## **7. Common Build Issues & Fixes**

### **Gradle Errors**

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### **Java Version Issues**

Ensure `JAVA_HOME` points to JDK 11 or JDK 17.

### **Android SDK Missing**

In Android Studio → **SDK Manager**:

* Install latest Android SDK Platform
* Install Android Build-tools
* Install Platform Tools

### **APK Not Installing**

Enable on device:

* Developer Options
* USB Debugging
* Install Unknown Apps

---

## **8. Running on a Physical Device**

Check connected devices:

```bash
flutter devices
```

Run:

```bash
flutter run --release
```

Installs the optimized version directly.

---

## **9. Web Build (Optional)**

```bash
flutter build web
```

Output folder:

```
build/web
```
